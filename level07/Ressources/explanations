In this one we have a binary file, we use gdb and disassemble the main, "set
disassembly-flavor intel" is recommended before "disas main", we see a call to
get env getting the 0x8048680 value, which when we translate it to gdb with "x/s
0x8048680" gives us LOGNAME

We now translate the next cmd "0x8048688" which is "/bin/echo %s" and it prints
level07 -- the logname

We set logname as "export LOGNAME='$(getflag)' after execution, the binary gives
us the flag :)
