To go through this one we are going to exploit the /usr/bin/env echo, we will
look for a place we can create symlinks and files which will be in /tmp, then we
create a symlink like :
	"ln -s /bin/getflag echo"
The objective of this is to run the getflag function as the user that uses the
script, which will be obviously flag03

Then, we export the path variable to search for echo in our own directory like:
	"export PATH=.:$PATH"

We only need now to launch the ~/level03 from our tmp dir to execute getflag and
find our flag
