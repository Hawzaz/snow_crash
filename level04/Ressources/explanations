We see a perl script at ~, and when we look deep into the system we can find the
same script at /var/www which means thata web server is listening, the shell
script is giving us the information that it's listening on port 4747 and
printing a variable named x, so we send it a x variable containing our getflag
command like

curl -d x='$(getflag)' localhost:4747 e.g the quotes are here to make our var
into str

We then get our flag :)
