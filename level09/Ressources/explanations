In this one we try to play with the binary file, we see that it rotates by 1
each character, incrementing at each, so in or order to decode our token we will
reverse the process, we proceed the hexdump -C and get the hex 66 34 6b 6d 6d 36
70 7c 3d 82 7f 70 82 6e 83 82 44 42 83 44 75 7b 7f 8c 89, we translate it to dec
and get 102 52 107 109 109 54 112 124 61 130 127 112 130 110 131 130 68 66 131
68 117 123 127 140 137 then we do a little c loop written in enorme.c and output
our token, connecting to flag09 and getting the flag :)
