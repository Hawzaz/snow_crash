In this final level, we're finding nothing on the ~, neither on the system. We
qill need to sort it our by ourselves so we'll go for what we've learned
previously !

We just learned how to bypass a getuid, so lets think how does getflag works
right ? :D

Exactly hehe, the point is : there is a ptrace killing us while we're debugging
this binary, but how does ptrace works ? 

Under ptrace we look for the asm which does :
test eax, eax

Basically (after looking for it on the internet) this does exactly a cmp eax,0

We're breaking at test like : b *0x0804898e then run and do a little set $eax=0

We're through ! Lets bypass the getuid now, easy work for us :)

Find the place under the getuid and then go through a breakpoint and change the
eax register again !

b *0x08048b0
s
set $eax=3014 (3014 is the id of flag 14 can de found in /etc/passwd)
r

And here is our flag :) 

For the flex, we can su as flag 14 and use getflag

"Congratulation. Type getflag to get the key and send it to me the owner of this
livecd :)"

PS : He uses the same :), like me hahahaha !
