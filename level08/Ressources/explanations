 In this level we have a binary file, we use strings on it and see that it reads
 the file we give as an argument, unfortunately we have no read permission on
 the token that we need, in order to bypass this, we create a symbolic link to
 the token "ln -s token pouet" and launch "./level08 pouet", we can read the
 file since we have the permission and it redirects to the token which is
 iquif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean, we can now log as flag08 and get our flag to the
 next level :)
