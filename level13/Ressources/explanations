In this level we have a binary that requires us to have an uid of 4242 to give
us the flag, in order to do so we look for infos on how to change ouruser id but
there is nothing on this side, we use gdb to disassemble it and see that it is
doing comparisions directly on the registers. We only need to set a breakpoint
in gdb to the cmp instruction like 
b *0x0804859a (sets a breakpoint to the 0x0804859a address)
set $eax=4242 (set the register value to 4242)
s (steps into the program and run it)

We have "your token is 2A31L79asukciNyi8uppkEuSx" as an exit ! :)
