For this level, we see a lua file which will be a total bait. We are going to use
an echo exploit. The difference is that the file is executed somewhere where we
have no access. We can run something in the echo command and output it in a
place everybody can see (the /tmp dir :)), we will send "$(getflag) > /tmp/flag"
as a password and it will execute "echo $(getflag) > /tmp/flag | sha1sum", we
don't care about the shasum as our flag will now be pickable in the /tmp dir,
get it and go directly to level 12 with it !
