On this level we have a perl script that executes an argument we give via $^xx
in the script, we see that our args goes through 2 regex, one which will put it
in uppercase and one that only takes the first group of the arg, we will create
a very simple script like :

#!/bin/sh
getflag > /tmp/xd

we now need to call it, to cummunicate we see that the script is listening on
the 4646 port, we use curl as we did in level04 but the uppercase problem isnt
solved. 
The * charcter is very powerful, we will move ou script to tmp and call it "A"

We see that if we do cat /*/A, it prints our script and we dont need upercases,
the tricky part will now be the one where we execute into the curl line, exactly
as we did in level04 : curl -d x='$(/*/scr)' localhost:4646

We now have our flag in /tmp/xd !
